# Cardiogenesis_Repo
Cardiogenesis Repo
This repo contains scripts for the single cell analysis and BPNet analysis for the Cardiogenesis dataset

The single cell analysis code is based off ArchR (https://www.archrproject.com/index.html) and the notebooks contain modifications to standard archr functions when they are used in the manuscript.
The BPNet code base uses two other repos : KerasAC (https://zenodo.org/record/4248179#.X8skj5NKiF0) and seqdataloader (https://zenodo.org/record/3771365#.X8skqZNKiF0) as part of the data processing and model training scripts.

BPNet models are available at Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6789181
