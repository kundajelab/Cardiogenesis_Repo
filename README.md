Cardiogenesis Repo
This repo contains scripts for the single cell analysis and BPNet analysis for the Cardiogenesis dataset

The BPNet code base uses two other repos : KerasAC (https://zenodo.org/record/4248179#.X8skj5NKiF0) and seqdataloader (https://zenodo.org/record/3771365#.X8skqZNKiF0) as part of the data processing and model training scripts.
