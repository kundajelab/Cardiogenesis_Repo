This folder contains relevant files for BPNet model training and CHD mutation analysis

1. Folder "peaksets" contains all the peak files used for training the BPNet models. The bigwigs used for training the models are deposited on GEO and the ucsc cell browser.

2. Folder "tobias_weights" contain the five fold bias weights required to train the BPNet models. The trained BPNet models are available for download via zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6789181.YxpMN5PMKdZ. The model code training the BPNet models are archived in KerasAC (https://zenodo.org/record/4248179#.X8skj5NKiF0) and seqdataloader (https://zenodo.org/record/3771365#.X8skqZNKiF0) as part of the data processing and model training scripts.

3. PCGC folder contains the files required for the CHD mutation analysis presented in the manuscript.
